00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The carbon footprint of global tourism is huge.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
A new study shows that tourism produces about eight percent of the world’s carbon emissions.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
This is much more than scientists previously believed.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
Tourism includes transport, accommodation, shopping, and food consumption by travelers.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
The researchers said flying was the biggest cause of carbon emissions from tourism.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Other major contributors include hotels, souvenirs, and restaurants.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
The study was carried out by researchers from Australia, Taiwan, and Indonesia.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
They analyzed tourism data from 189 countries.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
The researchers warned that tourism emissions are growing faster than those from manufacturing.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
They said international travel is increasing every year.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
Many people now travel more often and for longer distances.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
The researchers said governments must act to reduce tourism’s environmental impact.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
They suggested cleaner transport and more sustainable travel choices.

01:32.000 --> 01:40.000
They also said travelers should think carefully about how often and how far they travel.
