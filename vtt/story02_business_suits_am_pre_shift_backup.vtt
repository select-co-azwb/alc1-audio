00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Business suits and ties worn less and less.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
More and more companies around the world are telling staff they do not need to wear a suit and tie.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.000
In the last century, most business people and office workers had to wear business clothes.

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000
In today's world, that is becoming less important.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
Companies now want their workers to dress in a more casual way.

00:47.000 --> 00:58.000
This is to make staff feel more relaxed, so they work harder.

00:58.000 --> 01:12.000
The latest international company to relax its dress code is the investment bank Goldman Sachs.

01:12.000 --> 01:26.000
It said its staff could choose not to wear a suit, but asked employees to "exercise good judgment" in deciding how to dress for work.

01:26.000 --> 01:40.000
It said the shift was due to the changing nature of workplaces, generally in favor of a more casual environment.

01:40.000 --> 01:53.000
Many people in business think more casual dress is not a good thing.

01:53.000 --> 02:10.000
Justin Urquhart Stewart, founder of the investment company 7IM, said not wearing a suit and tie could give a bad impression to clients and customers.

02:10.000 --> 02:25.000
He said you are looking after people's money, so you should behave and dress respectfully.

02:25.000 --> 02:43.000
I would not expect to hand over my pension to someone in jeans, loafers and a football shirt.

02:43.000 --> 02:58.000
It may be old-fashioned, but I think it would be dangerous for a business to do that.

02:58.000 --> 03:10.000
He added that if you let people dress sloppily, that is how your brand will be perceived.

03:10.000 --> 03:26.000
Many companies, like Google and Amazon, allow their staff to dress casually and wear jeans and T-shirts to the office.
