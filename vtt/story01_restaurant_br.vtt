Restaurant bans customer for eating too much.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
A sushi restaurant in Germany has banned a customer for eating too much food.

00:12.500 --> 00:17.000
The customer was an ironman athlete called Jaroslav Bobrowski.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
He visited the Running Sushi restaurant in Bavaria last weekend.

00:22.500 --> 00:29.000
He paid 15.9 euros, about eighteen point four nine dollars, for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Mr. Bobrowski then sat down and ate nearly a hundred plates of sushi.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
When he went to pay for his meal, the owner told him that he could no longer return to the restaurant, because of how much he ate.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
He told a local newspaper, “I’m banned from now on because I ate too much.”

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
He said the decision of the owner left him feeling stunned.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
He told reporters that he was a regular customer at the restaurant.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Mr. Bobrowski said he ate so much because of his ironman diet.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
He follows a diet where he does not eat for twenty hours and then eats until he is full.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
He had no problems eating at the restaurant on previous visits.

01:18.500 --> 01:24.000
But the last time, the manager decided the amount he ate was not good for business.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
The owner told a German news agency that, “He eats for five people. That is not normal.”

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
A newspaper said the restaurant waiter did not accept a tip from Bobrowski when he went to pay.

01:41.500 --> 01:49.000
Bobrowski said, “When I went to the checkout, I wanted to leave a tip, but the waiter did not want to accept it.”

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
He now needs to find another restaurant that provides delicious and good value meals.
