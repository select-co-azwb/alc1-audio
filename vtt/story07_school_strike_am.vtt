School children go on strike for climate

00:06.500 --> 00:11.000
School children around the world have been going on strike.

00:11.500 --> 00:16.000
They are unhappy that their governments are doing too little to fight climate change.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
The strikes are part of a growing international movement called School Strike for Climate.

00:23.500 --> 00:31.000
Instead of going to school, students across the globe have been skipping classes to take part in street protests.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.000
Many of the protests have been outside government buildings.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
The movement began in August 2018 when Swedish student Greta Thunberg stood outside Sweden's government every Friday.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.000
She held a sign that read: "School strike for climate".

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Photos of her went viral on social media.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Students organized themselves and copied Ms. Thunberg's actions.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
The movement is growing worldwide.

01:00.500 --> 01:07.000
In 2019, strikes have taken place across Europe, North America and Australia.

01:07.500 --> 01:12.000
Over 45,000 students protested on one day in Switzerland and Germany.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
Students have held banners reading, "Why learn without a future?" 

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
"If you do not act as adults, we will" 

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
and "Like the sea level, we rise."

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
The first worldwide strike will take place on March 15.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Many scientists, politicians and teachers congratulated the students for their activism.

01:36.500 --> 01:40.000
However, not everyone is on the students' side.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.000
Australia's leader called for "more learning in schools and less activism".

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
A journalist in the U.K. wrote: "If children really must wag their fingers at older generations for some imaginary sin, 

01:53.500 --> 01:59.000
I wish they'd do it at the weekend."
