Nicer people are poorer, says study

00:06.500 --> 00:12.000
New research shows that nicer people are likely to be poorer than people who are not so nice.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
Researchers looked at how the personalities of different people affected how rich or well off they were.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
The researchers found that people with a nice, warm personality were worse off financially than people who were more selfish.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Kinder people found it more difficult to look after their money.

00:35.000 --> 00:45.000
Researcher Dr. Joe Gladstone said this was because of the "agreeableness" of people who were kinder, more trusting and more caring.

00:45.500 --> 00:59.000
He said: "We find that agreeableness is associated with various signs of financial hardship, including lower savings, higher debt and higher default rates."

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
The researchers looked at data from different sources, including two online surveys taken by almost 4,000 participants.

01:09.500 --> 01:19.000
The data included answers to questions on people's financial situation, how people got into debt, and people's attitude towards money.

01:20.000 --> 01:29.000
They compared this data with surveys in which almost 5,000 people answered questions about their personality and their agreeableness.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
The researchers said agreeable people seemed to care less about money and so did not look after or manage their money wisely.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Researcher Sandra Matz said that being kind and trusting had "financial costs". 

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
She wanted to better understand, "why nice guys seem to finish last".
