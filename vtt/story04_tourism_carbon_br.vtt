00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The carbon footprint of global tourism is huge.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
A new study shows that tourism produces about eight percent of the world’s carbon emissions.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
This is much more than scientists previously believed.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
Tourism includes transport, accommodation, shopping, and food consumption by travellers.

00:28.000 --> 00:36.000
The researchers said flying was the biggest cause of carbon emissions from tourism.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
Other major contributors include hotels, souvenirs, and restaurants.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
The study was carried out by researchers from Australia, Taiwan, and Indonesia.

00:52.000 --> 01:01.000
They analysed tourism data from 189 countries.

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
The researchers warned that tourism emissions are growing faster than those from manufacturing.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
They said international travel is increasing every year.

01:21.000 --> 01:31.000
Many people now travel more often and for longer distances.

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
The researchers said governments must act to reduce tourism’s environmental impact.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
They suggested cleaner transport and more sustainable travel choices.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
They also said travellers should think carefully about how often and how far they travel.
