Cartoon character ban could come to candy bars

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Candy and chocolate manufacturers in the UK may have to stop using cartoon characters on their products.

00:15.000 --> 00:23.000
An alliance of health groups said many food companies use characters from Peppa Pig and Disney on their packaging.

00:23.500 --> 00:28.000
The companies use the characters to get children to buy chocolate and candies.

00:28.500 --> 00:35.000
The health groups said 51 per cent of products using cartoon characters were unhealthy for children.

00:35.500 --> 00:42.000
The products fell below the health requirements needed to advertise on TV during children's shows.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
The health groups said the products were very high in fat, sugar and salt.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
The groups are asking the government to ban the use of these characters to sell unhealthy products to children.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
There are three groups trying to get a ban on cartoon characters on chocolate and candy.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
They are Action on Sugar, Action on Salt and the Children's Food Campaign.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
They looked at the nutrition content of 526 products that were aimed at children.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.000
The products' wrapping had colorful cartoon characters to appeal to children.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
The Peppa Pig Candy Bites were among the worst products.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.000
These contained 99 percent sugar.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Dr. Kather Hashem, a nutritionist from the Action on Sugar group, said: 

01:35.500 --> 01:44.000
"It's shocking that companies are exploiting the health of our children by using cartoon characters on their high-sugar food and drink products,

01:44.500 --> 01:54.000
particularly on chocolates and sweets, which are already hard to resist for children."
