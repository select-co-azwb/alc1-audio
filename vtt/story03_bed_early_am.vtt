00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The phrase “The early bird catches the worm” may be true.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It means people who wake up early get more done than people who don’t.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Another saying is from former U.S. President Benjamin Franklin.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
He said, “Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Scientists have found that people who go to bed before 11 p.m. may do better in life than people who sleep around 2:30 a.m.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The researchers are from Birmingham’s Centre for Human Brain Health in the U.K.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Their research showed that people who slept and rose early had an advantage over people who slept and woke up late.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The early sleepers are often called early birds, while late sleepers are known as night owls.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
There were differences in brain function between early birds and night owls.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The scientists tested 38 people in their research.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The people answered questionnaires about their sleeping patterns and when they felt tired during the day.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They were then placed into either an early bird group or a night owl group based on their answers.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
All of the people had MRI scans of their brains and completed different tests throughout the day.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The early birds said they felt less sleepy and were able to complete the tests more quickly than the night owls.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The researchers said there were big differences between the two groups.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They explained that night owls often have to wake up earlier for school and work.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This means they are constantly fighting against their natural preferences and body rhythms.
