Restaurant bans customer for eating too much.

00:07.500 --> 00:13.000
A sushi restaurant in Germany has banned a customer for eating too much food.

00:13.500 --> 00:18.000
The customer was an ironman athlete called Jaroslav Bobrowski.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
He visited the Running Sushi restaurant in Bavaria last weekend.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
He paid 15.90 euros, about eighteen dollars and forty-nine cents, for an all-you-can-eat buffet meal.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Mr. Bobrowski then sat down and ate nearly a hundred plates of sushi.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
When he went to pay for his meal, the owner told him that he could no longer return to the restaurant, because of how much he ate.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
He told a local newspaper, “I’m banned from now on because I ate too much.”

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
He said the decision of the owner left him feeling stunned.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
He told reporters that he was a regular customer at the restaurant.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Mr. Bobrowski said he ate so much because of his ironman diet.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
He follows a diet where he does not eat for twenty hours and then eats until he is full.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
He had no problems eating at the restaurant on previous visits.

01:14.500 --> 01:20.000
But the last time, the manager decided the amount he ate was not good for business.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
The owner told a German news agency that, “He eats for five people. That's not normal.”

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
A newspaper said the restaurant waiter did not accept a tip from Bobrowski when he went to pay.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Bobrowski said, “When I went to the checkout, I wanted to leave a tip, but the waiter did not want to accept it.”

01:40.000 --> 01:51.000
He now needs to find another restaurant that provides delicious and good value meals.
